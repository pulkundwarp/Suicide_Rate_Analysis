# <p align = "center"> Suicide Rate Analysis (1985 - 2016) </p>

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

As a student who has tackled depression and reading news about suicides all over the world, I have always wondered what factors play a role in suicide. This project seeks to explore the underlying factors. We will use a sample of 44,000 gather data from 141 different Countries, between the 80's to 2016.

 # OVERVIEW

Data is collected from `kaggle`: https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016

In this mini-project, we will perform the following steps -

1. Data Wrangling <br>
2. Exploratory Data Analysis<br>
3. Machine Learning + Predictive Analytics <br>
4. Conclusions <br>
5. References <br>


Finally, I have generated a report to present my findings to the audience using `Google Sites`- <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/suicide-rate-analysis">https://sites.google.com/view/suicide-rate-analysis</a>

# QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

We will try to find the answers for the following questions during our analysis -

1. Which year has the most suicides cases? Which year has the least suicides cases?
2. Which `country` has the most suicides cases? Which country has the least suicides cases?
3. Is there any relation with `Age groups` and `Number of Suicide cases`?
4. What is the relationship between `gender` and the `Number of suicides cases`?
5. Additional Analysis

# CONCLUSIONS

1. While suicide rates dipped in the 80s, potentially due to increased awareness and recognition of mental health struggles, they've unfortunately climbed again in recent years.

2. Though lack of Soviet-era data makes it difficult to confirm, Russia's high suicide rate may be linked to widespread alcohol consumption. 

3. The data paints a troubling picture: middle-aged adults (30-60) bear the brunt of suicides, with elderly and adolescents experiencing roughly half the rate.

4. Sadly, suicide ranks high among causes of death for all US adults. Notably, men are significantly more likely to take their own lives than women, with mental health playing a key role in the tragedy.
